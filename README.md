### Day 1

I spent the first 15 or so minutes being salty about the theme choice, and
hoping that somebody would create an unofficial alternative theme like they did
last time. After that, I spent a few hours working on a very large and complex
matrix of theme combinations, which can be found here:

After that, I started working on porting over some changes from my TimberWolf
game engine to ArcticWolf so I'd have some useful framework/engine features
ready once I came up with my theme combo.
